The purpose of this project is to select the populars words in reviews for several Amazon product categories and use the dataset from the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cynthiarempel/amazon-us-customer-reviews-dataset.

Our methodology includes:
- **Statistical Computation**: Fisrt, construct files (project.R, project.sh, and project.sub), and apply these files to one category. And run these files on CHTC to make sure they can work. Then, we broadcast our single analysis flow to all categories by CHTC.

### Content
#### data
- Our data sourced from Kaggle, which link is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cynthiarempel/amazon-us-customer-reviews-dataset. The file here contains the results of the most popular words. 

#### code
- This contains R scripts, a shell script, and a sub script for the analysis ranging from reading data, data cleaning, counting words frequency, getting outputs, as well as txt files containing the name of each category.

#### image
