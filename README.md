The purpose of this project is to perform a modern statistical analysis from the **business** dataset. Our methodology includes:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: to investigate the variables' distributions along with the outliers
- **Data cleansing**: to clean the data by imputing some observations which areirrational and create a new cleaned dataset
- **Statistical Model**: to construct a model that effectively infers and describes the variables based on the existing data. We also conduct the experiment to select the best model
- **Shiny App**: to develop a real-time web application based on our model

### Content
